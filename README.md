# Python_Projects

My repository of Python projects whilst I develop my skills. Below is a description of each project, and how I adapted these myself.

ðŸ§™ Harry Potter Top Trumps: Created this project as part of the Code First Girls course - Python & apps. I worked in a group to create a top trumps style game with the Harry Potter                             API.
