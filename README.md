# Python_Projects

My repository of Python projects whilst I develop my skills. Below is a description of each project, and how I adapted these myself.

üßô Harry Potter Top Trumps: Created this project as part of the Code First Girls course - Python & apps. I worked in a group to create a top trumps style game with the Harry Potter API.

üìù Mad Libs: Project 1 from a Python projects course on Udemy. I adapted the original code to allow users to choose between 3 different stories. I added a while loop to avoid the program ending if the user inputs an invalid choice.
